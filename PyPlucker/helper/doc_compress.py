        # see that code above?  it's the obvious way, but it's slow.
        # what it does is basically do string.find on the data ahead
        # of the current position, on an ever-shrinking buffer.  With
        # that code, this function took around 1.6 seconds per call
        # (on a Cyrix M2-266 [207 MHz/83 MHz bus/1MB cache]).
        #
        # The below is a bit different: basically, it takes advantage
        # of the fact that if we don't have a length 3 substring, we
        # can't possibly have a length 4 substring, and so on.  Thus,
        # it first looks for a length 3 substring (we don't care about
        # anything shorter).  If it finds one, it then attempts to
        # find a length 4 substring between that position and the
        # current location, and so on.
        #
        # I suspect the primary benefit of this is to avoid 6 out of 7
        # calls to string.find every time we aren't looking at a
        # compressible string.  At any rate, changing this code cuts
        # the time to about 0.38 seconds per call.
